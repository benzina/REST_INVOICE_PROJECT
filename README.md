# REST_INVOICE_PROJECT
In this project, we create a Spring Boot REST application that incorporates industry level project design.
We are developing CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations
that can be used by any other even non-java application and write bug free CRUD operations, including exceptions &amp; exception handlers.
Equally important, we are used several annotations :
@RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping, @Modifying, @Query,
@Transactional, @RestControllerAdvice, @ExceptionHandler, @ControllerAdvice, @ResponseBody, @RequestBody, @PathVariable, @Data,
@NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @Entity, @Component, @Service, @Autowired. 
We are worked with Spring Boot Data JPA repository interface and write modular &amp; reusable code. 
Moreover, we are implementing dynamic code with minimal changes, keeping future change requests in mind,
and we are developing an integration layer to get interoperability. And we are integrating swagger UI to test REST Application.
